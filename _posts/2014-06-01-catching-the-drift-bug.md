I've been following drifting here in the Pacific Northwest since around 2007, and in general since the early 2000's. While watching everything is great, A few years ago I really felt like it was time to start driving myself instead of just sitting around. So, before taking my first trip to japan I saved up some money and went to the [Team Orange Drift School](http://www.driftschool-jp.com/e/driftlesson.html) at Ebisu Circuit in 2012

Once I got back I was hooked and the beginning of the following year in 2013 I signed up for my local [Evergreen Drift](http://evergreendrift.com) School to get more seat time! Luckily, I got paired up with my good friend Gaelen Norman from [NorthwestNissans](http://northwestbnissans.com) and [BigBoy Media](http://bigboymedia.net) who gave me plenty of pointers during the skidpad session.

I then set-off to flail around and suck during the solo runs, but still had a blast!

After those 2 tastes, I wanted to drive more consistently. So, In the beginning of 2014 I made a clear goal to start getting more consistent seat time.
First up, I went over to my local track Evergreen Speedway for one of the Open Drift events. It wasn't my first time being there, but was my first time driving. Overall, I had a good time. However, due to the amount of waiting to drive(roughly 1 hour), and general format of how things went(3 runs of 3 corners), I wanted to drive somewhere else other than Evergreen Speedway.

I had heard of a cool tight/technical track down in Oregon. Being roughly 3 hours south, I was hesistent to make the trip incase something broke. However, one day I decided to throw caution out the window and not worry about crap I can't control. So, I packed up some tires with my friend Kyle Robertson from [Krafted Photography](https://www.facebook.com/pages/KRafted-Photography/321167974652177), stopped by to pick up another buddy and headed down to [Pat's Acres Racing Complex(PARC)](http://parcdrift.com) 30 minutes south of Portland in Canby,OR.

One thing I quickly realized, the wait line was about the same as evergreen. However, the time during your actual run was longer, and time between runs was shorter. This meant more laps, more seat time, and more learning!

<br>

Aside from seat time, another thing that this track presented was a wide range of techniques and car control.Instead of just doing 3 turns, you had up to 10 turns all of different types.

<br>

Due to this, It took some getting used to, and I ended up learning the hard way.

After getting into a fight with some bushes, I decided it was a good time to take a lunchbreak and checkout the damage. Luckily, I came away with only minor stuff so onward I drove. Unluckily however, I broke my the center section of my type-x valence...which nissan doesn't sell anymore.

After a few warm-up laps I really started to settle in and get some quality lines going along with some dirt-drops here and there!

<br>

As the track dried out, I could really feel the speed start coming in, especially on the longer sweeper section.

But.....then the rain came back. But, this time...with a vengence.

Instead of waiting for the rain to letup, everybody said skrew it, and forged on through the giant lakes that im supposed to call puddles. lol

<br>

As expected, I sucked my first time down there having only driven 3 times over the course of 2 years. But, it was a good way to knock off the rust at a low speed while still having fun.

Its hard to put into words just how awesome this track was, and you can tell by the smile on my face how much fun I had. It definitely reminded me alot of some of the tight and technical sections of Ebisu from when I did the drift school out there.

I took a quick stop through Portland on the way home after the event to recover a bit and grab some food. One thing I realized..3.5 hours to an event, driving, then driving 3.5 hours back all in the same day is pretty damn tiring. Either way though, I knew I needed to go back there as soon as possible!
