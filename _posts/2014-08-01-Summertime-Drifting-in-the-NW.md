After having the time of my life down at PARC back in the Spring of 2014 I thought "I HAVE to come back here!". So, I did and was able to experience just how awesome summertime drifting in the Northwest really is! If you haven't seen my last post on [Catching The Drift Bug](http://{{ site.url }}/catching-the-drift-bug/), I reccomend going to check it out!
<br>

Around Mid July 2014 I had a free weekend and pinged my friend Thomas who I had met at the Evergreen Drift event earlier that year about drifting down at PARC. After working out some details, we made the 3 hour trek back down, and posted up in the pits with our purple s13's.

This time I was able to experience driving in the full dry for the first since since 2012 and man, was it sweet.

I also got my first taste of tandeming, which is a blast in the dry!

<br>

I was pretty blown away with how smooth and consistent Thomas was the entire day. So, I tried to run with him as much as possible.

<br>

After the long day, one of Thomas' friends was kind enough to let us crash at his place before making the 3hour trek back north to Seattle. I have to say, doing it this way instead of right after the event like last time makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE. Having a good nights rest under my belt definitely made the journey back home more enjoyable.
Later the following month, I caught wind of PARC Fest, which is similar to Ebisu's Drift Matsuri in that its a 2-day drift day where you camp out at the track. This sounded like tons of fun, so once again Thomas and I loaded up as many wheels and tires as we could fit and made the trip down south.

When everything started, I underestimated just how much fun I was about to have over the next 2 days.

From dirt-drops and catching air...

The whole thing was just one giant party and I LOVED every minute of it!

Going into the night after day 1, everybody was just hanging out around campfires, drinking beer, and having a great time. After relatively minor hiccups the first day, I was looking forward to day 2!

<br>

After burning up the last of my 17" wheels the following morning, I ran into a problem....the 18" wheels I brought didn't fit on either one of our cars. This is where I really found out just how cool the drift community here in the NW is. I walked over to the Pit area of Justin Lucas and some other Oregon area/Xcessive Manufacturing guys and wanted to see if they wanted to swap me some 17's for my 18's so I could continue driving for the rest of day #2.

<br>

Not only did they swap with me, but Justin's friend was having issues with his car. So, he just GAVE me 3 sets of 17's to tear up as long as I just gave him the wheels back when I was done. I was pretty blown away to say the least. Outside of Drifting, I couldn't imagine this happening anywhere else. So, I threw on the loaner wheels and continued to have a blast!

Towards the end, I managed to rip off my exhaust from 50-50 grinding a rumble-strip. After ripping off my exhaust, and proceeding to do another run I realized this was quite possibly one of the best summers I've had in a very long time.
